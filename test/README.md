Test for GNSNet [NUnit]
=====================================
The contents of this directory and its subdirectories are the test codes for GNSNet. The solution and project file is created in VC++ 2008 express, while the external testing framework is NUnit. Only 'nunit.framework.dll' from NUnit is included here as it is needed to be linked when building the test project. The full framework and the test runner should be downloaded on its official website (www.nunit.org).

- Visual C++ 2008 express or higher
- NUnit 2.0+
