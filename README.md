GNSNet [Managed C++ Network Wrappers]
=====================================
Library that simplifies network programming in managed C++ (CLR/.NET),
the library provides a very simplified interface for communicating to the 
network using TCP/IP sockets, UDP sockets and FTP client. 
This library is also packaged with a simple "seamless TCP/IP server". i.e. 
you can have a simple yet fully working multi-client server just by invoking 
StartService() method at the instance of ServerSocket.

Platform
============================
This library can be used in any .NET language under .NET framework 2.0 and up.
It is written in C++.NET but it can be compiled as a DLL and can be easily used
using other .NET languages like C# and VB.NET.

Requirement
============================
.NET framework 2.0 and up
